Binangkal Recipe

Ingredients:

1 1/2 cup all purpose flour 3/4 cup powdered milk 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/3 cup sugar 1 tablespoon melted butter (or margarine) 1/4 cup evaporated milk 1 piece egg 1/2 cup sesame seeds Oil for deep frying

Directions:

In a large bowl, add the all purpose flour, powdered milk and baking powder. Combine and mix well.

In another bowl, combine the sugar, evaporated milk, melted butter and egg. Mix until well combined.

Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture. Mix until well combined. Knead for a few minutes until smooth and sticky.

Grab a small portion of the mixture and then roll into a ball. Then, coat them with sesame seeds.

When fully covered by sesame seeds, roll them again in your palm to make sure that the seeds will not fall.

Do these steps with the rest of the ingredients. Heat a lot of oil in a pan.

Deep fry the binangkal balls until golden brown.

Transfer them to a strainer or paper towel to drain excess oil.

Transfer the binangkal to a serving plate.

Enjoy this with your favorite afternoon tea or coffee.
