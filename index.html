            In a large bowl, add the all purpose flour, powdered milk and baking powder. Combine and mix well.<br>

            In another bowl, combine the sugar, evaporated milk, melted butter and egg. Mix until well combined.<br>

            Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture. Mix until well combined. Knead for a few minutes until smooth and
            sticky.<br>

            Grab a small portion of the mixture and then roll into a ball. Then, coat them with sesame seeds.<br>

            When fully covered by sesame seeds, roll them again in your palm to make sure that the seeds will not fall.<br>

        Do these steps with the rest of the ingredients. Heat a lot of oil in a pan.<br>

        Deep fry the binangkal balls until golden brown.<br>
        
        Transfer them to a strainer or paper towel to drain excess oil.<br>
        
        Transfer the binangkal to a serving plate.<br>
        
        Enjoy this with your favorite afternoon tea or coffee.<br>
